### SIS Experiments (Section 4, informative feature comparisons)

**Note: These experiments are provided as is. No guarantee that they will 
run bug-free**

*N.B.: I never had time to clean them up but for the sake of completeness I am adding them here. :)*

Make sure you install the `SIS` repository:
```
https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/sufficient_input_subsets
```

Then you can use `sis_backward_selection.py` as "inspiration" to run these 
experiments.
